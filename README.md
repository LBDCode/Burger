# Eat da Burger

Eat da Burger is a simple "almost" CRUD app that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebar to add, view and edit burger entries.  Enter the name of a burger you'd like to eat, or browse the burgers already available.  Once you've made your selection, hit the "Eat the Burger!" button to update the burger's status and see it move to the "Eaten" section of the page.
